## Project Description

### Table Detection and Recognition

This project aims to develop an end-to-end solution for table detection and recognition in documents and images. The primary goal is to build a system that can automatically detect tables within documents, extract the tabular data, and recognize the contents of the tables using optical character recognition (OCR) techniques.

### Technologies and Methods

The project utilizes a combination of computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques to achieve table detection and recognition. The following technologies and methods are employed:

1. **OpenCV**: OpenCV is used for image preprocessing and contour detection to identify potential table regions within documents.

2. **Mask R-CNN**: The Mask R-CNN architecture is employed for table segmentation and pixel-wise object detection. This deep learning model allows us to precisely delineate table boundaries.

3. **Tesseract OCR**: The Tesseract OCR engine is used for text recognition within the detected tables. It provides support for multiple languages and is well-suited for recognizing text in various formats.

4. **EasyOCR**: EasyOCR is another OCR library that is employed for recognizing text in the tables.

### Project Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture to enable easy extensibility and maintainability. The major components include:

1. **Table Detection**: This module focuses on using OpenCV and Mask R-CNN to detect table regions within documents and images.

2. **Table Recognition**: The table recognition module employs Tesseract OCR and EasyOCR to extract text from the detected tables.

3. **Data Post-Processing**: The extracted tabular data is further processed using NumPy and Pandas to organize and present it in a structured format.

4. **User Interface**: A simple user interface is provided for interacting with the system, allowing users to upload documents and visualize the detected tables along with recognized text.
